FAQ
Do you have a bank where I can take and give freely? (e.g. for crafting goods)
We're working on getting a bank. We need 10 members. Once we hit 10, we will have a bank that you can openly take and give to. I hope to keep this policy as long as people are reasonable.

Tips
Dungeons
Stay together. This makes it easier to apply heals and buffs.
Watch your feet; don't stand in boss AOEs.
Block heavy attacks and interrupt channel effects from enemies. This reduces enemy heals and damage dealt to the group for quick kills.
Multiple enemies? Tank, pull and taunt them, then DPS drop AOEs.
Dungeon roles
Tank, keep the boss on you and in one place turned away from the group. Don't run around the room, this helps with the first tip.
DPS, stay behind the boss.
Healer, keep vision on the group. When everyone is full health and buffed, do damage. Have a heavy healing and a healing/dps skill build ready to swap between for different scenarios.
