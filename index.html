          <b>Do you have a bank where I can take and give freely? (e.g. for crafting goods)</b></br>
          We're working on getting a bank. We need 10 members. Once we hit 10, we will have a bank that you can openly take and
          give to. I hope to keep this policy as long as people are reasonable.
