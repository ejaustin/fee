            A casual guild for those who like to travel the world of Elder Scrolls. No matter your drive, you're welcome. As we
            say:
            <li>Don't be a jerk.</li>
            <li>Take as you need, give as you can.</li>
            <li> And don't be greedy, at least when it comes to our bank. How you amass your treasures is up to you.</li><br>

            Our goal is to have an open bank policy where people can take as they need, and give as they can. Our guild house has basic crafting stations, and cats. If there's interest, we can vie for a guild trader as the guild grows.<br><br>

          <b>Do you have a bank where I can take and give freely? (e.g. for crafting goods).</b><br>
          We're working on getting a bank. We need 10 members. Once we hit 10, we will have a bank that you can openly take and
          give to. I hope to keep this policy as long as people are reasonable.
